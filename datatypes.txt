                   DATATYPES



Definition :

In javascript a data type defines the type of value that can be stored and manipulated in a program
A data type in javascript is a classification that tells the interpreter what kind of  value a variable holds,such as number,strings,booleans,object,etc.

Category :
Primitive datatype
Non primitive datatype

Primitive datatype :
			
JavaScript has seven primitive data types — (Primitive Data type is predefined by the language and named by a reserved keyword.)

Types : 	
1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol
7. BigInt

Non primitive datatype :
			
Non-primitive data types, also known as reference types, are objects in JavaScript. Unlike primitive types, which store actual values, non-primitive types store references to the values. This means that when you manipulate a non-primitive type, you’re working with a reference to the original value, not a copy.

 Types : 
Objects
Arrays
Functions
Data
RegExp

String : 
		
In javascript a string is a sequence of characters (letters,numbers,symbols)enclosed in single quotes(‘),(“).

	
Example:



		//Using single  quotes
		let name1=’hello’;
				
		//Using double quotes
		let  name2=”javascript”;
		
		//OUTPUT
 		console.log(name1); // hello
		console.log(name2); // javascript

Arrays : 
	
In JavaScript, an array is a single variable that is used to store different elements. It is often used when we want to store a list of elements and access them by a single variable. It’s a more convenient way to store and structure information 
	
Example:
				
Arrays in javascript are ordered collections of values,which can be of any datatype.They are fundamental for storing and manipulating lists of related data.
					
		//Creating an array

		let fruits=[“Apple”,”banana”,”mango”,”orange”];
		
		//Accessing array elements

		console.log(fruits[0]);   //Output : Apple
		console.log(fruits[2]);  //Output : Mango
